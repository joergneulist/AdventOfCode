The main directory contains scaffolding and library code, each year has its own subdirectory. My implementation has a git submodule (private repo) for the puzzles inputs in path data. If you're me, clone this way:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/joergneulist/AdventOfCode.git
```

Also, add the session cookie data in ```aoc/session```. That's it.
